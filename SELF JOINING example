/* Breaking down each step:

We want title of each movie next to its sequel, so we select title of movies and sequel of movies (from movies).
SELECT movies.title, sequel.title AS sequel
FROM movies

We want the sequel to each movie on the left side of the query:
LEFT OUTER JOIN movies sequel

Narrow it down to specific desired values. Specify by the sequel ID and movie ID:
ON movies.sequel_id = sequel.id;

And that's it!
