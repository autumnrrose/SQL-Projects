1. We want to select people's names from table 1 and the same people's hobbies from table 2:
SELECT persons.fullname, hobbies.name

2. All of this information is coming from table 1 
(PERSONS):
FROM persons

3. We are joining information from table 2 (HOBBIES) so we join from hobbies:
JOIN hobbies

4. Specify what we are looking for, which is that the person ID is the same thing as the person ID from HOBBIES:
ON persons.id = hobbies.person_id;

All done! */



/* Now, use another SELECT with a JOIN to show the names of each pair of friends, based on the data in the friends table. */

/*
1. We want one friend's full name and the other's full name:
SELECT a.fullname, b.fullname

2. We are obtaining the information from the FRIENDS table which is going to be a number:
FROM friends

3. One table join:
JOIN persons a
ON a.id = friends.person1_id

4. Second table join w specific parameters:
JOIN persons b
ON b.id = friends.person2_id;
